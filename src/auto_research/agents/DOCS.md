# `auto_research.agents` — per-role wrappers

## Purpose
Thin wrappers around the provider layer that bind a role to its prompt
(`prompts/<role>.md`), its allowed tools, and its expected I/O schemas. One class
per role — reviewer, librarian I/O, librarian searcher, analyst worker, analyst
lead ([CLAUDE.md §10](../../../CLAUDE.md#10-agent-architecture--process-loop)).

## Architecture
Each role is a small async class:
1. Construction loads its prompt file and resolves its model via
   `auto_research.models.registry`.
2. Each public method accepts a task schema, returns a result schema.
3. Tool access (sources, retrieval, sandboxed toolkit calls) is injected — not
   imported globally — so swap-outs in tests are trivial.

Critical: **runtime LLMs never see `CLAUDE.md` or any `DOCS.md`**
([CLAUDE.md §4](../../../CLAUDE.md#4-claudemd-and-docsmd-are-build-time-only)).
Only the file in `prompts/` plus task data goes into the model.

## Interfaces / Contracts
*To be populated in step 8.* Planned classes:
- `ReviewerAgent`, `LibrarianIOAgent`, `LibrarianSearcherAgent`,
  `AnalystWorkerAgent`, `AnalystLeadAgent`.

## Dependencies
- Internal: `auto_research.models`, `auto_research.schemas`,
  `auto_research.sources`, `auto_research.retrieval`,
  `auto_research.observability`.

## Dictionary-level reference
