# `auto_research.graph` — LangGraph orchestration

## Purpose
Assembles the agents into the process loop described in the Phase 1 system tour
([CLAUDE.md §8](../../../CLAUDE.md#8-what-phase-1-built-the-system-as-it-stands)) and
exposes async entry points for both monitored runs (`ResearchRun`) and verdict-only
compatibility (`ReviewVerdict`).

## Architecture
A LangGraph `StateGraph` with six nodes and two outer feedback edges (each
capped at `max_iterations`, default 3). Tool execution is owned by analyst
workers inside their `analyze()` ReAct loop via persistent per-worker sandboxes —
not by graph nodes.

```
START → literature → review_literature
                        │  needs_more_literature & lit < cap
                        ▼─────────────────────────────► literature   (loop ①)
                        │
                        ▼
                     analysis → review_analysis
                                  │  needs_rework & analysis < cap
                                  ▼─────────────► analysis  (loop ②)
                                  │
                                  ▼
                             finalize_run
                                  │ accepted + report formats
                                  ▼
                             compose_report → END
```

Reviewer nodes return state updates containing the newest `ReviewVerdict`.
`add_conditional_edges()` then routes from `review_literature` back to
`literature` or onward to `analysis`, and from `review_analysis` back to
`analysis` or onward to `finalize_run`. `finalize_run` copies the latest
accumulated verdict into `state["verdict"]`, then either routes to `compose_report`
on an accepted verdict with requested report formats or exits to `END`.

**Honest-failure routing (§9.6).** `after_analysis` inspects the adjudicated
`AnalystReport.status`: an `ok` report goes to `review_analysis`; a `failed`/`needs_human`
report routes **straight to `finalize_run`**, bypassing reviewer rework (an honest failure is
a *correct* outcome with no penalty). `finalize_run` then emits a non-accepted `ReviewVerdict`
for those, so `route_after_finalize` exits to `END` — **no report is composed**, never a
fabricated one.

**Tool execution inside `analysis_node`:** `analysis_node` calls
`consensus_strategy.run(workers, lead, task)`. Each worker's
`AnalystWorkerAgent.analyze()` runs the inner ReAct loop over `SandboxToolProvider`
when sandbox + registry are attached, writes real `ToolResult`s to its private
`memory_path`, and exposes `last_tool_results`. `DebateToConverge` injects a
truncated cross-worker summary into `task.instructions` for the next round.

The literature node follows a four-step pipeline:
1. **IO agent composes search strategy** — `io_agent.compose_search_strategy()`
   translates the research intent (and optional reviewer follow-up) into a
   focused `SearchRequest`.
2. **IO agent queries online sources** — `io_agent.search()` hits external
   APIs (arXiv, NASA ADS, web). No LLM ranking; raw results only.
3. **IO agent downloads and abstracts** — `io_agent.ingest_results()` downloads
   PDFs, runs `IODebateToConverge`, and writes `mem_abbrev` to SQLite.
4. **`text_search_paths()` queries local SQLite** — pure Python, no LLM.
   Returns `list[Path]` for papers with downloaded PDFs. The reviewer receives
   these paths and loads each as a full PDF `DocumentRef` attachment.

The analysis node builds an `AnalysisTask` from the question and optional
instructions (carrying the reviewer's `follow_up` on rework).

`ResearchState` carries: the request, a `list[Path]` literature set, the latest
analyst report, the final reviewer verdict, accumulated reviewer verdicts, two
iteration counters, and the cap.

## Interfaces / Contracts
- `build_graph(*, reviewer, io_agent, retrieval=None, workers, lead,
  consensus=None, max_iterations=3, registry=None, monitor=None) -> CompiledStateGraph` —
  pure constructor.  `retrieval` defaults to `SqliteRetrievalBackend()`.
  `consensus` defaults to `DebateToConverge(max_rounds=max_iterations, monitor=monitor, registry=registry)`.
  `registry` defaults to `ToolkitRegistry(Path("/data/fzhou/research_toolkit"))` and is
  used for tool catalogue injection into task instructions.
  Raises `ValueError` if `max_iterations < 1`. Reads no environment at import.
  `analyze_env`, `analyze_ini_sh`, `tool_retry_cap`, and `toolkit_root` are no longer
  `build_graph()` parameters — they are consumed when constructing `PersistentSandbox`
  and `DebateToConverge` in `runtime.py`.
- `async run_request(request, *, reviewer=None, io_agent=None, retrieval=None,
  workers=None, lead=None, consensus=None, max_iterations=None, chatter=10,
  monitor=None, monitor_jsonl=None) -> ReviewVerdict` — compatibility entry.
  Runs `run_research()` and returns only the final reviewer verdict.
- `async run_research(request, *, ..., chatter=10, monitor=None, monitor_jsonl=None,
  report_formats=None, human_handler=None, human_channel=None) -> ResearchRun` — high-level
  monitored entry. Resolves the raise-to-human channel (`hitl.resolve_handler` — explicit
  `human_handler` → `human_channel` → auto-detect TTY/library) then `await run_preflight(
  human_handler=…)` immediately (the launch-time checklist: `.env` + required keys, the
  author↔reviewer decorrelation, and — when a channel is resolved — a **channel ping** that
  must reply), so a misconfigured/unreachable-human run crashes before any LLM is constructed.
  The resolved handler is threaded to the analyst workers and the reviewer/lead tool providers
  so any role can `ask_human`.
  Missing dependencies are constructed from `config/models.yaml`. Reads
  `tool_retry_cap`, `toolkit_root`, `analyze_env`, and `analyze_ini_sh` from
  `config/orchestration.yaml`.  Creates per-run workspace
  (`<runtime_dir>/runs/{run_id}/`; `runtime_dir` from `config/orchestration.yaml`), spawns one `PersistentSandbox`
  per `AnalystWorkerAgent`, assigns each worker's `sandbox` and `memory_path`,
  then tears all sandboxes down after the graph completes or raises.
  Returns the request, final verdict, final state, and `RunMonitor`.
- `ResearchState` — `TypedDict` with `request`, `literature: list[Path]`,
  `report`, `verdict`, `verdicts: Annotated[list[ReviewVerdict], operator.add]`,
  `lit_iterations`, `analysis_iterations`, `max_iterations`.
  `tool_queue` and `tool_results` removed — tool state is now private to each
  worker's `memory_path` file and embedded in the final `AnalystReport`.
- Monitor events are optional. When a monitor is supplied, graph nodes record
  node starts, search strategy/results, local retrieval paths, analyst reports,
  worker tool-result summaries (via consensus/agents), reviewer verdicts, and report
  composition events.
- `IOAgentLike` / `ReviewerLike` — minimal protocols for dependency injection.
  `ToolWorkerLike` protocol removed from `builder.py` (tool execution moved to
  consensus/roles layers).
- Both outer feedback edges are gated by the reviewer's structured verdict flags
  (`needs_more_literature`, `needs_analysis_rework`). The reviewer's `follow_up`
  text is fed back into the next `compose_search_strategy()` call and/or analysis
  instructions. The routing is implemented with LangGraph conditional edges
  after each reviewer node has appended its verdict to `state["verdicts"]`.
- Live graph verification is opt-in:
  `AUTO_RESEARCH_LIVE_GRAPH_TESTS=1 pytest tests/test_live_graph.py -s`. Writes
  JSONL plus Markdown logs under `logs/dev/step-10/`.
- Live sandbox verification is opt-in:
  `AUTO_RESEARCH_LIVE_SANDBOX_TESTS=1 pytest tests/test_live_sandbox.py -s`.
  Writes logs under `logs/dev/step-11/`.
- LangGraph Studio: run `langgraph dev` from the repo root (requires
  `langgraph-cli[inmem]`). Server binds to `localhost:2024` on the remote
  machine. Over SSH, forward the port locally:
  `ssh -L 2024:localhost:2024 your_server`, then connect Studio from your
  laptop at `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://localhost:2024`.
  Alternatively run `langgraph dev --host 0.0.0.0` and use the server's IP.
  Entry point: `src/auto_research/graph/serve.py:graph`.

## Dependencies
- External: `langgraph`.
- Internal: `auto_research.agents`, `auto_research.consensus`,
  `auto_research.models`, `auto_research.retrieval`, `auto_research.schemas`.

## Dictionary-level reference
- `ResearchState` — TypedDict for the graph state; `literature` is `list[Path]`;
  `verdicts` is an accumulated list of reviewer decisions. Tool queues/results
  are not graph state; tool calls run inside analyst workers and are recorded in
  per-worker `memory.md` files.
- `IOAgentLike` — protocol with `compose_search_strategy()`, `search()`, `ingest_results()`.
- `ReviewerLike` — protocol with `async review(request, *, literature, report)`.
- `build_graph(...)` — constructs and compiles the six-node state graph
  (`literature`, `review_literature`, `analysis`, `review_analysis`,
  `finalize_run`, `compose_report`).
- `run_request(request, ...)` — compatibility entry point; delegates to
  `run_research()` and returns the final `ReviewVerdict`.
- `run_research(request, ...)` — monitored high-level entry point; returns
  `ResearchRun`. Reads `tool_retry_cap`, `toolkit_root`, `analyze_env`,
  `analyze_ini_sh`, and `mcp_servers` from `orchestration.yaml`, starts one
  persistent sandbox per analyst worker, and shuts down sandboxes/MCP clients in
  `finally`.
- `ResearchRun(request, verdict, final_state, monitor)` — result object with
  `.markdown()` for grouped monitor output.
- `_default_graph()` — synchronous; builds the compiled graph with all defaults from
  config. Called at import time by `serve.py` for LangGraph Studio.
- `load_orchestration_config(path?)` — loads `config/orchestration.yaml`; returns dict.
- `serve.py` — LangGraph Studio entry point; exposes `graph = _default_graph()` at
  module level so `langgraph dev` can import it. Referenced by `langgraph.json`.
- `DEFAULT_WORKER_COUNT` — default analyst worker count (currently 2).

## Changelog
- 2026-05-26 -> 2026-06-12 — Graph/runtime built and ReAct-wired: six-node LangGraph
  including `compose_report`, two capped feedback edges, Studio wiring, per-run workspace,
  one persistent sandbox per worker, MCP client lifecycle, read-only reviewer/lead tools,
  required-env checks, role-specific ReAct caps, report formats, and ReAct literature
  gathering.
- 2026-06-12 — Phase 2 step 0 added off-repo MCP server cwd pinning and lead read-only
  `toolkit_root` access; graph docs now reflect worker-owned tool execution.
- 2026-06-12 — Compacted changelog and refreshed the graph diagram/interfaces.
- 2026-06-15 — Phase 2 step 5: `run_research` resolves a raise-to-human channel
  (`human_handler`/`human_channel`), awaits the now-async preflight (incl. the channel ping),
  and threads the handler to the role tool providers; `after_analysis` routes an honest
  `failed`/`needs_human` report around the reviewer to `finalize_run` (no fabricated report).
